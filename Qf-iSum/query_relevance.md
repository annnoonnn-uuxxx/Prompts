Task Description:



{system_message}



As an expert in completing the task given to you, you will be doing the below-listed work one after the other in a sequence. You will read the Evaluation Criteria, Metric, and Evaluation Steps thoroughly before generating any part of the output.



You will be given comprehensive information regarding the recommended product for a query, including the user's query and the query-focused recommendation explanation summary for the recommended product. Your task is to evaluate and rate the query-focused recommendation explanation summary based on the given metric. Evaluate to what extent the query-focused recommendation explanation summary follows the given metric, considering the provided comprehensive information regarding the recommended product for a user-entered query as input. Use the following evaluation criteria to judge the extent to which the metric is followed. Make sure you understand the task and the subsequent evaluation metric very clearly. Strictly write the score in the given format.



Evaluation Criteria:



The task is to judge the extent to which the query-focused recommendation explanation summary follows the Query Relevance metric.



Scores and Evaluation Criteria:



<score>1</score> - The query-focused recommendation explanation summary does not align and match with the query entered by the user and completely fails to address the query. The summary is completely not relevant to the query. The information included in the summary is irrelevant to the user's requirements. The summary does not offer a precise, well-justified, and highly relevant explanation of how the recommended product is relevant to the user.



<score>2</score> - The query-focused recommendation explanation summary addresses only one of the attributes relevant to the query. Some relevant information is included, but much of it is irrelevant or not useful. The summary has most of the information irrelevant to the query and has very few details relevant to the query. The summary gives very little relevant explanation of how the recommended product is relevant to the user.



<score>3</score> - The query-focused recommendation explanation summary partially addresses the query. The majority of the information is relevant, though some irrelevant or not useful details are included. The recommended product and its attributes present in the summary are somewhat relevant to the query but may lack depth or clarity. The summary mostly offers a relevant explanation of how the recommended product is relevant to the user.



<score>4</score> - The query-focused recommendation explanation summary majorly but not fully addresses the attributes relevant to the query and has one or two irrelevant points. The information included is predominantly relevant and useful. The recommended product and its attributes align well with the requirements mentioned in the query. The summary offers almost precise and relevant explanation of how the recommended product is relevant to the user.



<score>5</score> - The query-focused recommendation explanation summary fully addresses all the attributes relevant to the query. All the information included is important and directly helps the user in making an informed decision. The recommended product and all of its attributes perfectly and completely align with the requirements present in the query. The summary offers a precise, well-justified, and highly relevant explanation of how the recommended product is relevant to the user.



Metric:



Query Relevance: Measures how well the query-focused recommendation explanation summary addresses the specific query provided by the user.



Evaluation Steps:



Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:



1. First, write down the steps needed to evaluate the query-focused recommendation explanation summary as per the Query Relevance metric. Reiterate what metric you will be using to evaluate the summary.
2. Understand the Query: Start by carefully reading and understanding the user's query.
3. Review the query-focused recommendation explanation summary: Go through the query-focused recommendation explanation summary provided for the recommended products.
4. Assess Attribute Relevance: Evaluate how many attributes of the recommended product which are present in the summary are relevant to the user-entered query and check if the attributes align well with the query.
5. Consider the User's Perspective: Act as a customer/user and determine whether the summary helps you, as a customer, to make an informed purchasing decision based on the query under your evaluation.
6. Assign a Score: Based on the above evaluation criteria, assign a score to the query-focused recommendation explanation summary.
7. Provide Detailed Explanation: Write a detailed explanation justifying your evaluation.
8. Format the Score: Conclude your evaluation with the score in the specified format: Score- <score>5</score>.



Note: Strictly give the score within <score></score> tags only e.g Score- <score>5</score>.



First, give a detailed explanation and then finally give a single score following the format: Score- <score>5</score>



THE EVALUATION AND SCORE MUST BE ASSIGNED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO THE METRIC ONLY AND NOTHING ELSE!
