Task Description:

{system_message}

You will be given comprehensive information regarding top three recommended products for a query, including query (entered by the user) and product title, base price, final price, and product opinion summary (for each of the three products respectively), using which a corresponding Comparative Explanation Summary has been generated. Your task is to evaluate and rate the Comparative Explanation Summary based on the given metric. Evaluate to what extent the Comparative Explanation Summary follows the given metric, considering the provided comprehensive information regarding top three recommended products for a query as input. Use the following evaluation criteria to judge the extent to which the metric is followed. Make sure you understand the task and the subsequent evaluation metric very clearly. Strictly write the score in the given format.

Evaluation Criteria:

The task is to judge the extent to which the Comparative Explanation Summary follows the metric.

Scores and Evaluation Criteria:

<score>1</score> - The Comparative Explanation Summary completely fails to follow the informativeness metric. It does not cover any of the important aspects present in the product opinion summaries of the three products.

<score>2</score> - The Comparative Explanation Summary follows the informativeness metric only to a limited extent. It covers a few important aspects, but most significant attributes discussed in the product opinion summaries of the three products are missing, providing minimal information for comparison.

<score>3</score> -The Comparative Explanation Summary reasonably follows the informativeness metric. It covers around half of the important aspects present in the product opinion summaries of the three products , providing a moderate level of information for comparison.

<score>4</score> - The Comparative Explanation Summary mostly follows the informativeness metric. It covers most of the important aspects present in the product opinion summaries of the three products, offering a substantial amount of information for comparison. However, a few minor aspects may not be fully addressed.

<score>5</score> - The Comparative Explanation Summary thoroughly follows the informativeness metric. It comprehensively covers all important aspects discussed in the product opinion summaries of the three products, providing a complete and detailed comparison. The Comparative Explanation Summary includes all essential attributes (product title, prices, key attributes, pros, cons, average rating) for each product, with any missing values properly marked as "N/A".

Metric:

Informativeness: Informativeness evaluates the extent to which the Comparative Explanation Summary comprehensively covers all relevant aspects and attributes of the products being compared. This metric assesses the presence and completeness of essential attributes in the tabular comparison, including the product title, price base price and final price, key attributes dynamically selected from the product opinion summaries of three products, pros, cons, and average rating. The Comparative Explanation Summary should dynamically select and include important attributes discussed in the product opinion summaries, ensuring that all majorly discussed aspects are covered. Summaries should be penalized for missing significant aspects and rewarded for thorough coverage of the provided information. Missing values should be properly marked as "N/A" to ensure completeness.

Evaluation Steps:

Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:

1. First, write down the steps needed to evaluate the Comparative Explanation Summary as per the Informativeness metric. Reiterate that the metric evaluates the extent to which the summary comprehensively covers all relevant aspects and attributes of the products being compared.
2. List the essential attributes and aspects that need to be covered in the summary, including:
- Product title
- Base price
- Final price
- Key attributes dynamically selected from the product opinion summaries
- Pros
- Cons
- Average rating
3. Cross-check each essential attribute listed above in the Comparative Explanation Summary. Ensure that the summary includes information for each attribute for all three products.
4. Verify the presence and completeness of each important aspect. Ensure that all majorly discussed aspects from the product opinion summaries are included in the Comparative Explanation Summary.
5. Check for any missing values and ensure they are properly marked as "N/A". Penalize the summary if significant aspects are missing or not properly marked.
6. Ensure that the Comparative Explanation Summary dynamically selects and includes key attributes from the product opinion summaries. Assess how well the summary integrates these dynamically selected attributes into the comparison.
7. Use the previous information to rate the summary using the evaluation criteria and assign a score within the <score></score> tags.
- Consider the following criteria while scoring:
- Coverage of all important aspects
- Completeness and presence of essential attributes
- Proper marking of missing values
- Effective dynamic selection and integration of key attributes from the product opinion summaries
8. Provide a detailed explanation of how well the Comparative Explanation Summary adheres to the Informativeness metric. Highlight any missing or inadequately covered aspects.
9. Finally, assign a single score following the format: Score- <score>5</score>. Ensure the score reflects the extent to which the summary follows the Informativeness metric based on the provided comprehensive information.

Note: Strictly give the score within <score></score> tags only e.g Score- <score>5</score>.

First give a detailed explanation and then finally give a single score following the format: Score- <score>5</score>

THE EVALUATION AND SCORE MUST BE ASSIGNED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO THE METRIC ONLY AND NOTHING ELSE!
